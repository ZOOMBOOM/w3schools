This repository is for the W3Schools tutorial

Hello!

This is my repository to keep the work of the W3Schools tutorials.

I have 2 reasons for creating this repository.

1. To keep record of the progress and work that I do on W3Schools tutorials.
2. Learn how to use Git.

I intend on going through all of the tutorials that I am interested in, which W3Schools has to offer, and at the same time learn how to use Git to record my work and progress.
